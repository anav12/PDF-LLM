D -Wave quantum \\ncomputer has been available for more than eight years. IBM has made its quantum \\ncomputer accessible via its cloud service. Also, Microsoft, Google, Intel, and NASA \\nhave b een heavily investing in the development of quantum computers and their \\napplications.

Various \\nquantum algorithms were developed since quantum computing was proposed in the \\n1980s (Benioff, 1980; Coles et al., 2018; Feynman, 1982; Montanaro, 2016) . The \\nmost well -known quantum algorithms are Glover’s database search algorithm and \\nShor’s integer factoring algorithm. Both quantum algo rithms are known to \\noutperform the algorithms for classical computers significantly and also be used for \\ncracking the encryption systems (e.g., AES, RSA, ECC), which have globally used \\non the Internet (e.g., online shopping sites.)

ExxonMobil has \\nexplored practical applications in the area of energy and chemical manufacturing, \\nsuch as optimiz ing a country’s power grid, developing more predictable \\nenvironmental modeling, and discovering new materials. Daimler Mercedes -Benz \\nhas been using a quantum computer to develop a new battery for electric vehicles. \\nVolkswagen has investigated the use of qu antum computers to find a solution for \\nthe optimization of traffic flows in Beijing, China.  \\nIBM, which owns 53 -qubit gate -based quantum computers, has been collaborating \\nwith more than 100 organizations, including the companies mentioned above, \\nacross ind ustries and made their 5 -qubit and 20 -qubit quantum computers available \\nvia their cloud service called “IBM Q Experience” (IBM, n.d.) . More than 200 third \\nparty research paper s on practical applications have been published with IBM \\nquantum computers. This cloud service provides a graphical user interface in a \\nbrowser to build quantum circuits on IBM’s simulators or real quantum computers \\nby dragging and dropping the icons, whic h represent quantum logic gates (e.g., \\nNOT gate), on the lines connected to inputs and outputs. Also, the quantum circuits \\ncan be built and run remotely by using Python with the Qiskit library installed on \\nthe user’s desktop computer.

The \\nstate of a qubit can  be written  as a vector |𝜓⟩.  \\nwhere 𝛼 and 𝛽 are complex numbers  ℂ, called probability amplitude, and \\nsatisfy |𝛼|2+|β|2=1. |𝛼|2 is the probability of getting the state  |0⟩ as the result \\nof the measurement on the qubit  |𝜓⟩ while |𝛽⟩2 is the probability of getting |1⟩.  \\n“|  ⟩” is a standard notation for specifying states in quantum mechanics, called \\ncolumn vector or ket vector in the Dirac notation.   The orthonormal basis |0⟩ and \\n|1⟩ can be written  as \\n|0⟩=[1,0]T,|1⟩=[0,1]T(2) \\n \\nQuantum states combine through the tensor product. For instance, t wo qubits state \\ncan be written  as |𝜓1⟩⊗|𝜓2⟩, where “ ⊗” indicates a tensor product, or more \\ncompactly  |𝜓1⟩|𝜓2⟩ or |𝜓1𝜓2⟩.

In Figure 1, photons are fired at the emitter and going \\nthrough the Filter -V, which allows only vertically polarized photons to go through. \\nWe assume only a single photon goes into Polarization Beam Splitter (PBS) at a \\ntime to make the example simpler.

When a quantum computer prepares n qubits in a superposition state as \\nits input for a quantum circuit ( Figure 3),  2n possible inputs can be processed  \\nsimultaneously.

A quantum computer takes a quantum state as the input and \\ncontrols the state to increase the probability of finding the answer in the output state \\nfor the computation. For instance, Shor’s algorithm manipulates the quantum st ates \\nto find prime factors of a large number. A significant difference between a classical \\n(electronic) circuit and a quantum circuit is the intermediate states in the circuits. \\nIn a classical electronic circuit, we can measure the interm ediate state since  zero \\nand one in binary is represented by the voltages (e.g., 0 volts and 5 vo lts) on a node \\nin the circuit. Thus, it is possible to find an error (e.g., 2.5 volts) by measuring the \\nvoltage in the circuit. However, in a quantum circuit,  the intermediate st ates are \\nlikely to be in a superposition state. If the superposition state is measured, the \\nquantum state is corrupted and becomes one of the two orthogonal base states (i.e., \\n|0⟩ or |1⟩) at the time of the measurement with the probabilities |𝛼|2 and |𝛽⟩2.   \\nFor example, when the photons in the equation (6) are measured, one of the four \\nstates (e.g.,  |𝜓1⟩|𝜓2⟩=|0⟩|1⟩) is observed with an equal probability (i.e., 1/4,) \\nbut all other information about the original state (6) are lost by the measurement. \\nIn other words, the measureme nt is a one -way operation that does not allow us to \\n|𝜓1⟩|𝜓2⟩={1\\n√2 |0⟩+1\\n√2 |1⟩}{1\\n√2 |0⟩+1\\n√2 |1⟩} \\n=1\\n2{[1,1]𝑇⊗[1,1]𝑇}=1\\n2[1,1,1,1]𝑇 \\n=1\\n2{[1,0,0,0]𝑇+[0,1,0,0]𝑇+[0,0,1,0]𝑇+[0,0,0,1]𝑇} \\n=1\\n2|0⟩|0⟩+1\\n2|0⟩|1⟩+1\\n2|1⟩|0⟩+1\\n2|1⟩|1⟩ (6)'),\n",

Therefore, quantum gates \\nmust have the same number of inputs as the outputs and must be reversible  with no \\ninformation loss by the gat es.

Therefore, a quantum circuit need s to be designed to manipulate the \\nprobability amplitudes of the qubits so that an expected result can be found by the \\nmeasurement with the probability higher than 1/2𝑛. In this section, two well -\\nknown quantum algorithms that significantly outperform clas sical algorithms are \\nintroduced.  \\n \\nGrover’s algorithm  \\n \\nThis database search algorithm is designed to find an item in an unordered list. For \\nexample, it can be used for speeding up brute force key search on symmetric key \\nencryption such as AES  (Bernstein, 2010) . It is known th at this algorithm requires \\n𝑂(√𝑁) operations to search an unsorted  array  of size N, which requires 𝑂(𝑁) \\noperations for classical algorithms (Grover, 1996) .   \\nThe idea of Grover’s algorithm is the following.  When the number 𝑥𝑎 that satisfies \\n𝑓(𝑥𝑎)=1 needs to be found in a large unsorted database, the qubits are set to be \\nin a superposition state of all possible ID numbers {𝑥=0,1,2,…,𝑁−1} as the \\ninitial state. To simplify the expression, the decimal notation is used for n-qubit. \\nFor example, |1⟩|0⟩|0⟩ is written as |4⟩. The initial state ( Figure 6) can be written \\nas  \\nwhere the initial values of 𝜌𝑥 are 1/√2𝑛  when 𝑁=2𝑛. Thus, ∑𝜌𝑥2𝑁−1\\n𝑥=0=1. \\n |𝜓⟩=∑𝜌𝑥|𝑥⟩𝑁−1\\n𝑥=0=𝜌0|0⟩+𝜌1|1⟩+𝜌2|2⟩+⋯𝜌𝑁−1|𝑁−1⟩(15)'),\n",

Quantum Key Distribution  \\n \\nQuantum cryptography (Gisin, Ribordy, Tittel, & Zbinden, 2002)  is currently one \\nof the most practical applications of quantum information science. The most well -\\nknown quantum cryptography is the quantum key distribution (QKD) protocol  \\n(Bennett & Brassard, 1984) , which has been implemented and commercially \\navailable for more than a decade. The OKD with the one-time pad  can provide \\ntheoretically unbreakable end -to-end security by utilizing quantum mechanical \\nproperties in a classical cryptographic protocol.  Here “unbreakable” means that the \\nsecurity of the cryptography does not rely on the complexity of the algorithm but a \\nphysical pr operty that prevents decryptions without the key.  The one -time pad is \\nclassical  cryptography known to be a perfect encryption scheme  (Schneier, 1996) . \\nThe protocol is simple as follows. A sender, cal led Alice, generates n-bit random \\nnumber K as a one -time shared key and delivers it to a receiver, called Bob, before  \\nthe communication.  \\n𝐾={𝑘𝑖=0,1 | 𝑖=1,2,3,…𝑛} \\nWhen Alice wants to deliver an n-bit secret message M to Bob, Alice performs \\nexclusive OR operations for each bit in M and K, respectively.  Then, she sends the \\nresulting bit sequence C to Bob and discards the K. \\n𝑀={𝑚𝑖=0,1 | 𝑖=1,2,3,…,𝑛} \\n𝐶={𝑐𝑖=𝑚𝑖⨁𝑘𝑖 | 𝑖=1,2,3,…,𝑛} \\nBob decrypts the ciphertext  C by pe rforming exclusive OR operations with the \\nshared key K and discards the K. \\n \\nThis is an entirely secure protocol. The random bit sequence added to the message \\nproduces an utterly random bit sequence. Since the key is used  only once, there is \\nno possible attack except making a guess of n-bit random bit sequence for an n-bit \\nmessage. The  problem with this method is that there is no perfectly secure way to \\ndeliver the key (i.e., K) to Bob prior to  the communication. If classical  cryptography \\nsuch as RSA or AES was used , the strength of the one -time pad protocol relies on \\nthe strength of th e classical cryptography, which is not a perfect encryption scheme. \\nQKD plays a significant role in delivering the keys for the one -time pad. The first \\nQKD was proposed by C.H. Bennett and G. Brassard in 1984, called BB84 \\nprotocol. BB84 uses photons to del iver a random sequence of bits, which will be \\nused as a shared key between Alice and Bob after the completion of the protocol. \\nWe introduce the implementation of BB84 with the photon polarization in the \\nfollowing discussion to be consistent with the experi ments introduced in section 2.  \\n \\nFigure 11 shows  a simple BB84 example, which is very similar to Figure 1.'),\n",

However, they have not be en disseminated widely through \\nthe community of information security practitioners.  \\nOne of the significant issues with a QKD for the practitioners is that there is no \\ncommercially available quantum repeater to extend the distance and to fan out \\nacross a n etwork. A photon is, by its nature, prone to interfere  with its environment.  \\nIt is not a critical problem for a short distance QKD scheme because the data \\ntransmitted over a quantum channel are random bits that can be discarded  when \\nthey have errors. For long-distance, the amplification of the signal (i.e., a photon) \\nis necessary  due to the high SNR (signal to noise ratio).  However, it is very \\nchallenging (if possible ) to develop a quantum repeater (Meter & Touch, 2013)  \\nsince replication  of a transmitted unknown photon is not possible due to the no-\\ncloning  theorem . Although quantum repeaters have been proposed (Briegel, Dür, \\nCirac, & Zoller, 1998; Jiang et al., 2009; Meter & To uch, 2013; Zwerger, Dür, & \\nBriegel, 2012; Zwerger, Pirker, Dunjko, Briegel, & Dür, 2017) , current \\ncommercially available QKD systems are generally designed to be used with point -\\nto-point dedicated connections between networks (Aleksic et al., 2015) . Thus, the'),\n",

Chen et \\nal., 2009; Elliott et al., 2005; Sasaki et al., 2011; Stucki et al., 2011) .  \\nIn 2018, the distribution of entangled photon pairs via a satellite was demonstrated . \\nIt enabled sharing the entangled photon pai rs between two locations separated by \\nmore than 1200 km (Yin et al., 2017) .   The satellite system may be used for \\nentanglement -based QKD (Ekert, 1991)  and as a repeater station for QKD \\nnetworks.   \\nAnother issue about QK D schemes is their security. The QKD schemes do not \\ngenerally guarantee that the origin of the message is genuine. If an eavesdropper is \\ncapable of compromising both quantum and classical channels, the man -in-the-\\nmiddle attack against QKD schemes is possible (Pacher et al., 2016; Svozil, 2005) . \\nTherefore, authentication functionalities need to be incorporated into QKD \\nschemes, especially for multipoint connections.  \\n \\nCONCLUSION  \\n \\nIn this paper, the fundamental principles used in the quantum computations and \\nthree well -known quantum applications were introduced . Quantum computing is a \\npromising technology, which chang es our lives in many ways. Quantum computer \\nimproves database search significantly and solves many optimization problems \\nused in business such as data analytics (e.g., big data (Philip Chen & Zhang, 2014) ), \\nlogistics (e.g., optimizing routes of 10,000 taxies  (Cusumano, 2018) ), and medical \\nresearch (Parsons, 2011)  while quantum computing can be a cyberse curity threat \\nuntil we have post -quantum cryptography (cryptographic algorithms that are secure \\nagainst the attacks by quantum computers  (L. Chen et al., 2016; Mailloux, Lewis , \\nRiggs, & Grimaila, 2016) .)  \\nAfter Shor’s and Grover’s algorithms were found, researchers have not found many \\nuseful quantum algorithms that substantially outperform classical algorithms. Shor \\nstates in his paper, “Any quantum algorithm offering a spee d-up over classical \\ncomputation must use interference; this phenomenon is unknown in classical \\ncomputer science, and most theoretical computer scientists are not used to \\nreasoning about it” (Shor & W., 2003) . As researches in quantum computing get \\nmore attention from government, industry, and academia, more useful quantum \\nalgorithms are expected to be found.   \\nAlthough it may take ten years  to build a quantum computer that significantly \\noutperforms classical computers, every business needs to think of new quantum \\napplications to prepare  for the day. As fortune 500 companies have kept investing \\nin quantum compu ting, there must be chances to find a high grade of gold ore in \\nthis research and business fields.'),\n",

Similarly , when we find one in 𝜓𝑜𝑢𝑡1, we know 𝜓𝑜𝑢𝑡2 is \\nalso one without measuring 𝜓𝑜𝑢𝑡2. In other words, the quantum state in 𝜓𝑜𝑢𝑡2 \\ndepends on the value observed in |𝜓𝑜𝑢𝑡1⟩. Thus, the outputs 𝜓𝑜𝑢𝑡1 and 𝜓𝑜𝑢𝑡2 \\ncannot be described independen tly.

When a quantum computer prepares n qubits in a superposition state as \\nits input for a quantum circuit ( Figure 3),  2n possible inputs can be processed  \\nsimultaneously. This quantum parall elism is one of the significant advantages of \\nquantum computers.  \\n \\n \\nFigure 3: n-qubit quantum circuit  \\n \\nQuantum Circuit and Measurement  \\n \\nAs mentioned earlier, computation is a process of manipulating th e states of a \\nphysical system. A quantum computer takes a quantum state as the input and \\ncontrols the state to increase the probability of finding the answer in the output state \\nfor the computation. For instance, Shor’s algorithm manipulates the quantum st ates \\nto find prime factors of a large number. A significant difference between a classical \\n(electronic) circuit and a quantum circuit is the intermediate states in the circuits. \\nIn a classical electronic circuit, we can measure the interm ediate state since  zero \\nand one in binary is represented by the voltages (e.g., 0 volts and 5 vo lts) on a node \\nin the circuit. Thus, it is possible to find an error (e.g., 2.5 volts) by measuring the \\nvoltage in the circuit. However, in a quantum circuit,  the intermediate st ates are \\nlikely to be in a superposition state. If the superposition state is measured, the \\nquantum state is corrupted and becomes one of the two orthogonal base states (i.e., \\n|0⟩ or |1⟩) at the time of the measurement with the probabilities |𝛼|2 and |𝛽⟩2.   \\nFor example, when the photons in the equation (6) are measured, one of the four \\nstates (e.g.,  |𝜓1⟩|𝜓2⟩=|0⟩|1⟩) is observed with an equal probability (i.e., 1/4,) \\nbut all other information about the original state (6) are lost by the measurement. \\nIn other words, the measureme nt is a one -way operation that does not allow us to \\n|𝜓1⟩|𝜓2⟩={1\\n√2 |0⟩+1\\n√2 |1⟩}{1\\n√2 |0⟩+1\\n√2 |1⟩} \\n=1\\n2{[1,1]𝑇⊗[1,1]𝑇}=1\\n2[1,1,1,1]𝑇 \\n=1\\n2{[1,0,0,0]𝑇+[0,1,0,0]𝑇+[0,0,1,0]𝑇+[0,0,0,1]𝑇} \\n=1\\n2|0⟩|0⟩+1\\n2|0⟩|1⟩+1\\n2|1⟩|0⟩+1\\n2|1⟩|1⟩ (6)'),\n",
